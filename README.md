# 42 Berlin Web Development Discovery Piscine

This repository contains my work from the **Web Development Discovery Piscine** at **42 Berlin**, 

which I attended from **10th February to 14th February 2025**. 

During this intensive 5-day program, I learned the basics of web development and gained hands-on experience with essential tools and technologies.

## Key Skills:
- **Web Page Structure**: Understanding the foundation of web development with HTML, including table creation and responsive web design.
- **Styling**: Using CSS for design and layout, including creating dropdown menus, profile cards, and implementing parallax scrolling.
- **Dynamic Effects**: Adding interactive elements like parallax scrolling and background color changes using JavaScript.
- **Event Handling**: Understanding how to work with DOM elements, events, and manipulate them with JavaScript.
- **Problem-Solving**: Building functional components like calculators using JavaScript, handling user input, and performing calculations.
